Easy HTTP

Source samples for quickly and easily setting up HTTP server for running code
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains source samples for series of posts on my blog about
the quickest way I know to set up HTTP server that will listen to requests,
run some code (possibly with parameters) and send back the result.

*This file will be updated with links to posts that explain the code as I
publish them*
